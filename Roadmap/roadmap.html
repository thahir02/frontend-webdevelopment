            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="pink">Code Editor : </strong>To write the html,js,etc we use the code editor like VS code is popular code editor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="pink">CSS : </strong>Cascading Style Sheets.It is like the skin of the website.It is responsible for the visual appereance of the wedsite.It is used develop faster design in different screen sizes and devices.

            <strong class="pink">JS : </strong>Java Script.Java Script brings alive the Static webpages.It is a Dynamic Programming language that introduces interactively making websites engaging and usercentric. <br>
            From simple animation to complex Funtions like <br>
            * Form Validation <br>
            * Asynchronous Data Fetching <br>
            Java Script plays a pivotal role.
        </li>
        <li>
            It is a magic behind the dynamic behaviour of the applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            To maximise the productiviy as a developer it's important to undertand how to use LLM(Large Language Models) such as : <br>
                    * ChatGPT <br>
                    * G Bard <br>
                    * Meta ,etc <br>
            The Prompt engineering helps lot how to get the mos helpful responses from the LLM's
        </li>
        <li>
             In Software Development the tracking and managing changes is crucial thisis where the version control Systems particularly git comeinto play.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="pink">Git : </strong>Git allows devlopers to track changes,collaborate seamlessly, and revert to previous versions if needed

        <li>
            On the other hand the <br>
            <strong class="pink">Github : </strong>Github is platform thaht host the git repositories facilitating collaboration code sharing and even Deployment as projects grow and evolve managing software libraries and dependencycan become a challenge.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="pink">Package Managers : </strong>Package Managers are tools designed to address this challenge.
            <br>
            Popular Package Managers like mpm or yarn helps devlopers manage install and update software libraries seamlessly they ensure that projects have the right versions of dependencies making the deployment process smoother. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Designing responsive and visually appealling website can be streamlined with the right tools.
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong class="pink">Sass : </strong>Sass is a CSS pre-processor it allows for Advanced Styling techniques variables and nested rules enhancing the styling process modern web applications demand efficicency,scalability and maintainability.
        </li>
        <li>
            Java Script Frameworks & libraries provide pre-written code to support these requriments.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong class="pink">Frameworks </strong>likes <br>
            * react Js <br>
